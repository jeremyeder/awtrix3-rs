## Release Process

### 1. Create Release Candidate

```bash
# Update version to release candidate (e.g., 1.0.0-rc.1)
cargo edit --manifest-path Cargo.toml --set-version 1.0.0-rc.1

# Commit and create RC tag
git add .
git commit -m "Release candidate 1.0.0-rc.1"
git tag -a v1.0.0-rc.1 -m "Release candidate 1.0.0-rc.1"
git push origin v1.0.0-rc.1
```

### 2. Validate Release Candidate

- [ ] GitHub Actions build succeeds for all platforms
- [ ] Release artifacts are created and uploaded
- [ ] Installation scripts work with RC binaries
- [ ] No critical issues reported during RC testing period

### 3. Create Final Release

```bash
# Update to final version
cargo edit --manifest-path Cargo.toml --set-version 1.0.0

# Update changelog
echo "## [1.0.0] - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" >> CHANGELOG_NEW.md
echo "" >> CHANGELOG_NEW.md
echo "### Added" >> CHANGELOG_NEW.md
echo "- Initial release" >> CHANGELOG_NEW.md
echo "" >> CHANGELOG_NEW.md
cat CHANGELOG.md >> CHANGELOG_NEW.md
mv CHANGELOG_NEW.md CHANGELOG.md

git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 4. Post-Release Tasks

- [ ] Verify crates.io publication succeeded
- [ ] Update Homebrew formula with new version and checksums
- [ ] Update documentation links and badges
- [ ] Announce release on relevant channels
- [ ] Update issue/PR templates if needed

## Hotfix Process

For critical bug fixes that need immediate release:

1. Create hotfix branch from release tag:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/1.0.1 v1.0.0
   ```

2. Apply minimal fix and update version:
   ```bash
   cargo edit --manifest-path Cargo.toml --set-version 1.0.1
   ```

3. Test thoroughly and create pull request to main

4. After merge, tag and release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix v1.0.1"
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

## Release Automation

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions:

- **Trigger**: Push of version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Builds**: Cross-platform binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Artifacts**: 
  - Compressed binaries with shell completions
  - SHA256 checksums
  - Installation scripts
  - Homebrew formula
- **Publishing**: Automatic publication to crates.io
- **Documentation**: API docs deployed to GitHub Pages

## Emergency Procedures

### Yanking a Release

If a critical issue is discovered after release:

```bash
# Yank from crates.io (prevents new installs, doesn't break existing)
cargo yank --vers 1.0.0

# Optionally un-yank after fix
cargo yank --vers 1.0.0 --undo
```

### Rolling Back

1. Create new version with fix
2. Do not delete GitHub releases (breaks existing links)
3. Mark problematic release as "pre-release" in GitHub
4. Update documentation to point to safe version

## Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (1.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (1.0.1): Bug fixes, backward compatible
- **Pre-release** (1.0.0-rc.1): Release candidates, alphas, betas

## Security Releases

For security-related releases:

1. Follow responsible disclosure practices
2. Coordinate with security team if applicable
3. Include security advisory in release notes
4. Consider backporting fixes to older supported versions
5. Notify users through multiple channels

## Dependencies
